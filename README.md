# Real-Time-Dataset-Model-Implementation
Worked on real time datasets using various classification and regression algorithms in R and Python.


Applying various classification and regression model techniques to predict the outcome in each of the problem statement.

Approach - 

1. Library for Preprocessing and Cleaning
2. Load all Classification Packages and Accuracy Packages
3. Load Data Set
4. Analyse the Data
5. LabelEncoder
6. Split the Data into Train and Test
7. Train the Model
8. Check Confusion Matrix and Accuracy
10. Data Visualization
